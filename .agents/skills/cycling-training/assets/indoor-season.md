# 16-Week Indoor Season Plan

**Goal:** Build winter base on the trainer, develop threshold and VO2max, prepare for spring outdoor season.

## Athlete Profile

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Indoor FTP | [YOUR_FTP] watts (test on trainer!) |
| Starting CTL | [YOUR_CTL] |
| Target CTL | [YOUR_CTL + 30-40] |
| Weekly hours | 6-10 hours |
| Start date | [START_DATE] (typically November) |

## Indoor Training Setup

### Essential Equipment
- ✅ Smart trainer (direct drive preferred)
- ✅ High-powered fan (3+ m/s airflow)
- ✅ HR monitor
- ✅ Sweat towel and mat
- ✅ Hydration within reach

### FTP Adjustment
**Critical:** Test FTP indoors and use indoor-specific zones.
- Indoor FTP is typically 5-10% lower than outdoor
- Do NOT use outdoor FTP for indoor training

### Cooling Protocol
- Fan aimed at torso/face
- Room temperature: <20°C (68°F)
- Open window if possible
- Poor cooling = 15%+ performance reduction

## Mental Strategies for Indoor Training

### Combat Boredom
1. **Entertainment rotation**: Podcasts → Music → Netflix → Zwift races
2. **Workout variety**: Don't repeat same workout within 2 weeks
3. **Social rides**: Zwift group rides, virtual racing
4. **Goal visualization**: Picture spring events during hard intervals

### Interval Focus Techniques
1. **Segment counting**: "Just 6 more minutes" instead of "20 minutes to go"
2. **Cadence games**: Vary cadence within target power
3. **Power matching**: Try to hold exact target wattage
4. **Breathing patterns**: Count breaths during recovery

### Heat Management
1. Multiple fans > single powerful fan
2. Minimal clothing
3. Ice water bottle
4. Open window even in winter
5. Cold towel on neck between intervals

---

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| CTL increase | +30-40 points |
| FTP increase | +5-10% |
| VO2max power | 5-min power improvement |
| Consistency | 85%+ workout completion |
| Readiness | Fresh legs for outdoor transition |

## Outdoor Transition (After Week 16)

1. First outdoor rides: Easy, focus on bike handling
2. Outdoor FTP test within 2 weeks
3. Expect outdoor FTP 5-10% higher than indoor
4. Gradually shift to outdoor-focused training
5. Maintain 1-2 indoor sessions/week for structure
