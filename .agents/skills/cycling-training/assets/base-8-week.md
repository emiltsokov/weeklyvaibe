```
Warm-up: 15 min easy spin, build from 50% to 65% FTP
Main: 60 min @ 65-75% FTP ([CALC: 0.65×FTP] - [CALC: 0.75×FTP] watts)
Cool-down: 15 min easy spin
Cadence: 85-95 rpm
Target TSS: ~65
Notes: Conversational pace, nose breathing should be possible
```

```
If riding: Very easy spin @ <55% FTP
Target TSS: ~20 (or 0 if rest)
```

### Thursday - Tempo (75 min)
```
Warm-up: 15 min progressive build
Main: 3 × 12 min @ 76-85% FTP, 4 min recovery between
Cool-down: 10 min easy
Target TSS: ~75
Notes: Steady effort, slight breathlessness but controlled
```

### Friday - Rest
Complete rest day.

### Saturday - Long Endurance (2.5-3 hours)
```
Warm-up: 20 min easy build
Main: 2-2.5 hours steady @ 60-70% FTP
Include: 3-4 × 5 min @ 75-80% FTP (tempo surges)
Cool-down: 15 min easy
Target TSS: ~150-180
Notes: Fuel every 45-60 min, stay hydrated
```

### Sunday - Recovery (45-60 min)
```
Very easy spin @ <55% FTP

```
Power: <65% FTP throughout
No intervals, no surges
Target TSS: ~40
```

### Thursday - Easy Endurance (60 min)

---

## Weeks 5-7: Progressive Build

Follow the same pattern as Weeks 1-3, with these progressions:

| Week | Sweet Spot Volume | Long Ride Duration | Weekly TSS |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| 5 | 2 × 25 min | 3 hours | 500-550 |
| 6 | 2 × 30 min | 3.5 hours | 550-600 |

Pre-test rest

### Wednesday - Rest

### Thursday - FTP Test
```
Option A: 20-minute test
- Warm-up: 20 min with 2 × 1 min hard efforts
- Test: 20 min all-out, best sustainable effort
- FTP = 20-min power × 0.95
- Cool-down: 15 min easy

Option B: Ramp test
- Warm-up: 10 min easy
- Ramp: Start at 100W, increase 20W per minute until failure
- FTP = ~75% of 1-min peak power
- Cool-down: 15 min easy
```

### Friday - Rest

### Saturday - Easy Endurance (90 min)

### Sunday - Rest or easy spin

**Week 8 Total TSS: ~300-350**

## Success Metrics

At the end of 8 weeks, you should see:

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| CTL increase | +15-25 points |
| FTP increase | +3-8% (if new to structured training) |
| Endurance | Can hold Z2 for 3+ hours without fade |
| HR:Power | Improved efficiency (lower HR at same power) |

## Next Steps

After completing this plan:
1. **If racing soon**: Move to Build phase with more intensity
2. **If continuing base**: Repeat Weeks 5-8 with +5-10% TSS
3. **If taking a break**: Deload for 1 week, then reassess goals
