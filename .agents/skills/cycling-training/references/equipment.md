## Cooling Equipment

### Fans (Critical for Indoor Performance)

**Research:** Fan at 3-4 m/s can improve sustainable indoor power (Fernandez et al. 2023; PMID: 35025720). In that lab protocol, mean workload was ~15% higher with fan cooling at the same HRR target.

| Tier | Models | Airflow | Price | Notes |
|------|--------|---------|-------|-------|
| Premium | Wahoo KICKR Headwind | 4+ m/s, HR-linked | $250 | Auto-adjusts to effort |
| Best Value | Lasko 20" High Velocity | 4+ m/s | $50-80 | Industrial, powerful |
| Budget | Any 18-20" floor fan | 3+ m/s | $30-50 | Multiple for best coverage |

**Optimal Setup:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│                             │
│    [Front Fan - Face]       │
│           ↓                 │
│       ┌───────┐             │
│ [Side]│ RIDER │[Side]       │
│  Fan →│       │← Fan        │
│       └───────┘             │
│           ↑                 │
│      [Trainer]              │
│                             │
└─────────────────────────────┘

Minimum: 1 powerful front fan (face/torso)
Optimal: 3 fans (front + 2 sides)
```
