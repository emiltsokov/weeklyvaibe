## Heat Acclimation

*Based on: Périard et al. 2015 (PMID: 25943654); Racinais et al. 2015 (PMID: 25943653)*

### Physiological Adaptations

Heat acclimation produces these adaptations:

| Adaptation | Magnitude | Timeline |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| Plasma volume expansion | +5-12% | Days 3-6 |
| Earlier sweating onset | Significant | Days 3-5 |
| Increased sweat rate | +10-25% | Days 5-10 |
| Lower sweat sodium | -20-40% | Days 7-14 |
| Lower core temperature | -0.2-0.5°C | Days 3-7 |
| Lower exercising HR | -5-15 bpm | Days 3-7 |
| Improved cardiovascular stability | Significant | Days 5-10 |
| Improved perceptual responses | Lower RPE | Days 5-10 |

### Active Heat Acclimation Protocols

**Short-Term (5-7 days):**
```
Duration: 60-90 min/session
Intensity: 50-65% VO2max
Environment: 35-40°C, 40-60% RH
Frequency: Daily
Expected: ~70% of full adaptation
```

**Medium-Term (8-14 days):**
```
Duration: 60-90 min/session
Intensity: Progressive (50→65-70% VO2max)
Environment: 35-40°C, 40-60% RH
Frequency: Daily or every other day (8-10 sessions minimum)
Expected: ~90% of full adaptation
```

**Long-Term (14+ days):**
```
Duration: 60-120 min/session
Intensity: Variable, include race-pace
Environment: 35-40°C, 40-60% RH
Sessions: 10-14 over 2-3 weeks
Expected: Full adaptation
```

### Passive Heat Acclimation

**Hot Water Immersion (HWI):**
```
Timing: Within 30 min post-exercise
Temperature: 40-42°C
Duration: 20-40 min
Frequency: Daily for 5-10 days
Target: Maintain core temp >38.5°C

Protocol:
1. Complete normal training
2. Immediately enter hot bath (40°C)
3. Progress temperature if tolerated
4. Maintain 30-40 min
5. Monitor for heat illness signs
```

**Sauna Protocol:**
```
Post-exercise sauna:
Temperature: 80-100°C (traditional)
Duration: 20-30 min (3×10 min with breaks)
Frequency: Daily for 7-14 days
Timing: Immediately after training
```

### Decay and Maintenance

**Adaptation decay:**
- Begins 2-3 days after last exposure
- ~50% lost within 7-10 days
- Faster loss than altitude adaptations

**Maintenance:**
- 1-2 heat exposures per week maintains ~75%
- Final session 2-3 days before competition

## Altitude Training

*Based on: Millet et al. 2010 (PMID: 20020784); Levine & Stray-Gundersen 1997 (PMID: 9216951)*

### Mechanisms of Benefit

1. **EPO stimulation** → Red blood cell production
2. **Hemoglobin mass increase** (1-3%)
3. **Improved oxygen-carrying capacity**
4. **Enhanced muscle efficiency**
5. **Ventilatory adaptations**
6. **Improved buffering capacity**

### Live High-Train Low (LHTL)

**Classic Protocol:**
```
Living altitude: 2,000-2,500m (6,500-8,200 ft)
Training altitude: <1,200m (4,000 ft)
Duration: 3-4 weeks minimum (ideally 4-6)
Daily exposure: 14-16+ hours at altitude

Expected benefits:
- Hemoglobin mass: +1-3%
- VO2max: +1-3%
- Sea-level performance: +1-2%
```

**Dose requirements:**
- Minimum: ~300-400 hours at altitude
- >14 hours/day living at altitude
- Training at low altitude for quality

### Live High-Train High (LHTH)

```
Altitude: 1,800-2,500m
Duration: 3-4 weeks
Training: Modified intensity (-5-10%)

Considerations:
- Training quality may be compromised
- Higher overtraining/illness risk
- Still effective if load managed
```

### Simulated Altitude

**Altitude Tents:**
```
Target: 2,500-3,000m equivalent
Duration: 8-12 hours/night
Total exposure: 300-400+ hours minimum
Camp duration: 3-4 weeks minimum

Protocol:
1. Start lower (2,000m) for 2-3 nights
2. Progress to 2,500-3,000m
3. Monitor SpO2 (target: 88-92%)
4. Ensure ventilation
5. Maintain hydration
```

**Intermittent Hypoxic Training (IHT):**
```
Protocol:
- Hypoxic: 3-7 min at 14-15% O2 (~3,000m)
- Recovery: 3-5 min normoxic
- Sessions: 60-90 min, 3-5x/week
- Duration: 3-4 weeks

Benefits: Repeated sprint, muscle adaptations
Limitation: Minimal hemoglobin mass effect
```

### Individual Response

**Responder categories:**
- ~50%: Strong EPO/Hb response
- ~30%: Moderate response
- ~20%: Minimal response

**Factors affecting response:**
1. Baseline iron status (ferritin >50 ng/mL)
2. Genetic factors (EPO gene variants)
3. Training status
4. Sleep quality at altitude
5. Individual hypoxic response

### Return to Sea Level Timing

**Option 1: Compete 1-3 days after descent**
- Benefit from elevated hemoglobin
- Risk: Some experience fatigue/"flat legs"
- Best for: Acute responders

**Option 2: Compete 14-21 days after descent**
- Neuromuscular "retuning" time
- Hemoglobin still elevated
- Best for: Peak championship performance

**Individual testing recommended**

## Cold Weather Training

### Physiological Effects

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Metabolic demand | Increased (shivering, thermoregulation) |
| Muscle efficiency | Reduced (cold muscles) |
| Power output | -5-10% in extreme cold |
| Fine motor control | Impaired |
| Perceived exertion | Increased |

### Performance Impact

- Optimal temp: 10-15°C
- Below 5°C: Progressive decrement
- Below 0°C: Significant challenge

### Clothing Strategy

**Layering System:**

| Layer | Function | Material |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Base | Moisture wicking | Synthetic or merino |
| Mid | Insulation | Fleece, synthetic |
| Outer | Wind/water protection | Softshell, windproof |

**Temperature Guidelines:**

| Temp | Upper | Lower | Extremities |
|------|-------|-------|-------------|
| 10-15°C | Arm warmers | Shorts/knee warmers | Light gloves optional |
| 5-10°C | Long sleeve, gilet | Knee/leg warmers | Light gloves, toe covers |
| 0-5°C | Thermal jersey + jacket | Thermal tights | Winter gloves, overshoes |
| <0°C | Multiple layers | Thermal + knee warmers | Heavy gloves, full overshoes, balaclava |

### Cold Training Considerations

**Warm-up:**
- Extended (20-30 min)
- Dynamic movements pre-ride
- Higher intensity to generate heat

**Nutrition:**
- Increased carbohydrate needs
- Warm fluids if possible
- Higher fat pre-ride for sustained energy

## Advanced Altitude Protocols

### Altitude Training Decision Framework

```
Available time for altitude camp?
├── <2 weeks
│   └── NOT recommended for hemoglobin benefits
│       → Consider IHT or heat training instead
├── 2-3 weeks
│   └── Minimum effective dose
│       → LHTL if possible, strict protocol
├── 3-4 weeks
│   └── Standard altitude camp
│       → Full LHTL protocol
└── 4-6 weeks
    └── Optimal duration
        → Maximum adaptation potential
```

### Altitude Tent Home Protocol

**Equipment:**
- Hypoxic generator (e.g., Hypoxico, Higher Peak)

Weeks 3-6 (Maintenance):
- Altitude: 2,500-3,000m equivalent
- Duration: 10-12 hours/night
- Target SpO2: 88-92%
- Monitor: Morning HR, sleep quality

Weeks 7-8 (Pre-competition):
- Maintain or gradually reduce
- Last night: 3-7 days before event
- Individual timing based on response
```

**Monitoring Checklist:**
- [ ] Morning resting HR (track trend)
- [ ] SpO2 upon waking
- [ ] Sleep quality (1-10 scale)
- [ ] Morning HRV if available

### Altitude + Heat Combined Protocol

*Research: Rønnestad et al. 2022 showed heat suit training at altitude increased Hb mass 2.4-2.6%*

**Protocol (advanced athletes only):**
```
Location: Altitude camp (2,000-2,500m)
Addition: Heat exposure via heat suit or heated room

Week 1:
- Altitude adaptation only
- No additional heat stress

Weeks 2-3:
- 3×/week heat sessions post-training
- 30-40 min @ 39-40°C (sauna or heat suit)
- Monitor for excessive fatigue

Week 4:
- Reduce heat exposure
- Maintain altitude living
- Focus on quality training
```

### Iron Supplementation for Altitude

**Pre-Camp Testing (4-6 weeks before):**
```
Required tests:
- Ferritin (target: >50 ng/mL, ideal >100)
- Hemoglobin
- Transferrin saturation
- Serum iron

If ferritin <50 ng/mL:
- Elemental iron: 100-200mg/day
- Take with vitamin C
- Avoid with calcium, coffee, tea
- Retest after 4 weeks
```

**During Altitude Camp:**
```
Maintenance dose: 50-100mg elemental iron/day
Timing: Morning, away from training
Monitor: GI tolerance
Note: Some absorb better with food despite reduced absorption
```

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

| Method | Cost | Effectiveness | Practicality |
|--------|------|---------------|--------------|
| LHTL camp (4 weeks) | €€€€ | High | Requires travel |
| Altitude tent (purchase) | €€€ | Moderate-High | Home-based |
| Altitude tent (rental) | €€ | Moderate-High | Flexible |
| IHT sessions | €€ | Low-Moderate | No sleep disruption |
| Heat training | € | Moderate (different mechanism) | Easy to implement |

### Who Responds to Altitude?

**Predictors of good response:**
1. Low baseline hemoglobin (more room to improve)
2. Strong EPO response (genetic)
3. Good iron status
4. Younger athletes (generally)
5. Those who sleep well at altitude

**Red flags (poor response likely):**
- Sleep apnea or severe altitude insomnia
- Very high baseline Hb (>16 g/dL)
- Iron deficiency not corrected
- Poor training response at altitude
- Frequent illness at altitude
