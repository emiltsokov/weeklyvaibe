## Masters Cyclists (40+)

### Physiological Changes with Age

**Research finding:** Peak endurance performance maintained until ~35, then modest decreases until 50-60, with steeper decline thereafter. High-performing masters can maintain 70-82% of 35yo capacity at 70 (vs 50-65% untrained).

| Factor | Change per Decade (after 30) |
|--------|------------------------------|
| VO2max | -1 to -1.5% per year (trainable) |
| Muscle mass | -3 to -8% (preventable with strength) |
| Max heart rate | -5 to -7 bpm (NOT trainable) |
| Recovery capacity | Decreased |
| Exercise economy | NO change with training |

**Primary decline mechanisms:**
- Reduced VO2max (primary driver)
- Decreased max heart rate (cannot be trained)
- Sarcopenia (fast-twitch fiber loss)
- Reduced stroke volume

### Training Modifications

**Volume:**
- Can maintain high volume if built gradually
- May need more recovery time between hard sessions
- Quality over quantity becomes more important

**Intensity:**
- High-intensity training still effective and important
- May need longer recovery between HIT sessions
- Consider 2:1 or 3:1 loading instead of 4:1

**Recovery:**
```
Recommendations:
- Minimum 48-72 hours between hard sessions
- Sleep: 7-9 hours (prioritize quality)
- Consider 2 rest days per week
- Active recovery more important
- Deload every 2-3 weeks
```

**Strength Training:**
- Critical for maintaining muscle mass
- Focus on bone-loading exercises
- 2x/week minimum during base season
- Maintain 1x/week year-round

### Training Distribution

**Polarized approach recommended:**
- 80-85% easy (Z1-Z2)
- 15-20% hard (Z4+)
- Minimize grey zone (protects recovery)

### Sample Weekly Structure (Masters)

**Traditional 7-day (40-49):**
```
Monday: Rest or very easy spin
Tuesday: 75 min with VO2max intervals
Wednesday: 60 min Z2 easy
Thursday: Rest or 45 min easy
Friday: 90 min with threshold/sweet spot
Saturday: Long ride (2-4 hr Z2)
Sunday: Easy recovery or rest
```

**9-Day Cycle (50+ recommended, Joe Friel method):**
```
Day 1: High intensity (VO2max or threshold)
Day 2: Easy recovery
Day 3: Moderate endurance
Day 4: Rest
Day 5: High intensity (different focus)
Day 6: Easy recovery
Day 7: Long endurance ride
Day 8: Easy recovery
Day 9: Rest
```

### Age-Specific Modifications

| Age | Key Modifications |
|-----|-------------------|
| 40-49 | Maintain intensity, 48h recovery between hard sessions |
| 50-59 | 2x/week strength, 48-72h hard session recovery, HRV monitoring |
| 60+ | 9-day cycles, injury prevention focus, maintain vs build mindset |

### Bone Health (Critical for Cyclists)

**Research:** 2/3 of professional and master cyclists are osteopenic (PMC3554602)

**Recommendations:**
- 2 sessions/week weight-bearing/impact exercise
- Heavy resistance training (forces bone adaptation)
- DEXA scan every 2 years for high-volume cyclists
- Adequate calcium and Vitamin D intake

### Cardiovascular Health

**Increased attention for masters cyclists:**
- Atrial fibrillation risk increases with age + training volume
- Structural heart changes cumulative after years of intensive training
- Symptoms may be subtle (fatigue, decreased performance)

**Recommendations:**
- ECG + echo before starting intensive training (>8 hrs/week)
- Repeat examination every 2-3 years
- If symptoms occur (palpitations, dyspnea, syncope) stop immediately and consult

→ See [injuries.md#cardiovascular-risks-of-endurance-training](injuries.md#cardiovascular-risks-of-endurance-training) for details

### Common Mistakes

- Not enough recovery between hard sessions
- Ignoring strength training
- Training through fatigue signs
- Comparing to younger self
- Not adjusting expectations

### Reverse Periodization Benefits

Masters often benefit from reverse periodization:
1. Intensity better tolerated when fresh
2. Volume can cause more injury risk
3. Mental freshness for indoor intensity
4. Build volume later with established fitness

## Female Cyclists

### Physiological Considerations

**Differences from males:**
- Lower absolute VO2max (higher per kg lean mass)
- Different substrate utilization
- Hormonal fluctuations affect performance
- Generally lower hemoglobin
- Different injury patterns

### Menstrual Cycle and Training

**Key research (McNulty et al. 2020-2021, PMC7916245):**
- 44.6% of collegiate athletes believe symptoms impair training
- Olympic Gold medals have been won in ALL cycle phases
- Perceived vs objective performance often don't match

**Cycle Phases:**

| Phase | Days | Hormones | Training Considerations |
|-------|------|----------|------------------------|
| Early Follicular | 1-5 | Low E/P | May have cramping; but can be optimal if symptoms managed |
| Late Follicular | 6-13 | Rising estrogen | Higher pain tolerance; good for HIT/strength |
| Ovulation | ~14 | Peak estrogen, LH | Increased ACL/tendon injury risk |
| Early-Mid Luteal | 15-24 | High progesterone | Higher core temp, reduced plasma volume; heat harder |
| Late Luteal | 25-28 | Falling hormones | PMS symptoms; consider lower intensity |

**Research findings (2022-2025):**
- Individual variation is extremely high
- Some women notice no difference
- Tracking over 3+ months helps identify patterns
- Only 35% of sports science includes female participants

### Practical Recommendations

**Tracking:**
- Use app or journal
- Note performance, energy, mood
- Identify personal patterns over 3+ months

**Training adjustments:**
- If high intensity feels hard in luteal phase → shift to endurance
- If feeling strong at certain times → schedule key workouts then
- Don't force; listen to body

**Nutrition considerations:**
- Iron needs higher (especially if heavy periods)
- Test ferritin regularly (target >50 ng/mL)
- Carbohydrate needs may be higher in luteal phase
- Ensure adequate energy availability

### Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S)

**IOC Consensus 2023 (PMID: 37752011):**
- Secondary amenorrhea prevalence: **56% in cyclists** (highest of all sports)
- Female cyclists at heightened risk due to energy demands

**Warning signs:**
- Amenorrhea or irregular periods (after sustained LEA)
- Frequent illness/injury
- Declining performance or plateau
- GI issues, mood changes
- Stress fractures

**Long-term consequences:**
- Osteoporosis/decreased bone density
- Cardiovascular issues
- Infertility
- Impaired cycling performance

**Monitoring markers:**
- Thyroid (T3) - good indicator of energy availability
- Ferritin, B12, Vitamin D
- DEXA every 2 years (high-risk)

**Action required:**
- Ensure adequate caloric intake around training
- Consult sports medicine physician
- May need to reduce training load
- NEVER ignore menstrual irregularities

### Contraceptive Considerations

- Hormonal contraceptives alter natural cycle
- Some research suggests minimal performance impact
- Individual response varies
- Discuss with healthcare provider if concerns

## Beginners

### Training Principles for New Cyclists

**Start conservatively:**
- Build aerobic base first
- Avoid high intensity in first 8-12 weeks
- Focus on consistency over intensity
- Learn proper technique

**Progression rates:**
- Volume: +5-10% per week (max)
- Intensity: Introduce gradually after base
- Allow 6-8 weeks before adding structured intervals

### Zone Focus for Beginners

**First 8-12 weeks:**
```
Zone 1-2: 100% of training time
Goals:
- Build aerobic base
- Learn to pace
- Develop bike handling
- Establish routine
```

**Weeks 12-24:**
```
Zone 1-2: 80%
Zone 3 (tempo): 15%
Zone 4+: 5%
Goals:
- Introduce tempo efforts
- First threshold work
- Continue base building
```

### Sample Beginner Plan (12 weeks)

**Weeks 1-4:**
```
Mon: Rest
Tue: 45 min easy
Wed: Rest or 30 min easy
Thu: 45 min easy
Sat: 60-90 min easy
Sun: 30 min easy or rest

Total: 3-5 hours
```

**Weeks 5-8:**
```
Mon: Rest
Tue: 60 min easy
Wed: 45 min easy
Thu: 60 min with 2×10 min tempo
Sat: 90-120 min easy
Sun: 45 min easy or rest

Total: 5-7 hours
```

**Weeks 9-12:**
```
Mon: Rest
Tue: 60 min with 3×10 min tempo
Wed: 45 min easy
Thu: 75 min with 2×15 min sweet spot
Sat: 2+ hr endurance
Sun: 60 min easy or rest

Total: 7-9 hours
```

### Common Beginner Mistakes

1. Too much intensity too soon
2. Not enough rest days
3. Comparing to experienced riders
4. Ignoring nutrition basics
5. Skipping warm-up/cool-down
6. Inconsistent training

### FTP Testing for Beginners

- Wait 8-12 weeks before first test
- Use ramp test (simpler pacing)
- Accept results may be volatile initially
- Retest every 6-8 weeks as fitness builds

---

## Time-Crunched Athletes

### Maximizing Limited Time

**Key research (ScienceDirect 2024):**
- **No association between volume and VO2max/TT performance in trained cyclists**
- Beyond necessary training volume, more doesn't equal better
- Longer interventions positively influence outcomes
- Zone 2-only approach oversold for limited time (<10h/week)

**Minimum effective volumes:**
- 5-7 hours/week can maintain fitness
- 3-4 hours/week still produces adaptations
- Key is training distribution, not total volume

### Training Priorities

1. **Two key workouts per week** (non-negotiable)
2. **One longer ride** (if possible)
3. **Recovery rides optional** (can be rest)

### Sweet Spot Training Benefits

For time-crunched athletes, sweet spot (84-97% FTP):
- High training stimulus
- Manageable fatigue
- Time-efficient
- Sustainable recovery

### Sample 6-Hour Week

```
Monday: Rest
Tuesday: 60 min: 15 WU + 3×10 min SS + 15 CD
Wednesday: Rest or 30 min easy
Thursday: 75 min: 15 WU + 5×4 min VO2max + 15 CD
Friday: Rest
Saturday: 2 hr endurance with tempo
Sunday: Rest or 45 min easy

Weekly TSS: ~350-450
```

### Sample 4-Hour Week

```
Monday: Rest
Tuesday: 45 min: 10 WU + 3×8 min SS + 10 CD
Wednesday: Rest
Thursday: 45 min: 10 WU + 4×3 min VO2max + 10 CD
Friday: Rest
Saturday: 90 min endurance
Sunday: Rest

Weekly TSS: ~250-300
```

### Indoor Trainer Benefits

For time-crunched:
- No travel time
- No traffic/stops
- 100% training time
- Can train in small windows
- Weather independent

### Efficiency Tips

1. Reduce warm-up if needed (10-15 min)
2. Interval sessions on trainer
3. Commute by bike (if practical)
4. Lunchtime sessions
5. Early morning before work
6. Quality over quantity always

## Return from Injury/Illness

### Detraining Rates (PMC10853933, PMC9398774)

**Short-term detraining (≤4 weeks):**
- VO2max: -4 to -14% in highly trained
- Reduced blood/plasma volume
- Decreased stroke volume
- Muscle glycogen stores decline

**Long-term detraining (>4 weeks):**
- VO2max: -6 to -20% in highly trained
- Left ventricular mass decreases
- Increased body weight
- Effect size: Short-term ES=-0.62, Long-term ES=-1.42

| Time Off | Expected VO2max Loss | Notes |
|----------|---------------------|-------|
| 1 week | Minimal (1-2%) | Glycogen may actually supercompensate |
| 2 weeks | 4-7% | Muscle endurance maintained |
| 4 weeks | 10-14% | Short-term threshold |
| 8+ weeks | 15-20% | Younger (<20) show greater decline |

### Return Protocol After Illness

**Mild illness (cold, minor infection):**
```
Days 1-3 post-symptoms: Rest
Day 4-5: 30-45 min very easy
Day 6-7: 45-60 min easy
Week 2: Return to normal volume, low intensity
Week 3: Introduce intensity gradually
```

**Moderate illness (flu, COVID):**
```
Until symptom-free: Rest completely
Week 1 post-symptoms: Easy only, 50% volume
Week 2: 60-70% volume, easy intensity
Week 3: 80% volume, introduce tempo
Week 4: Near-normal, introduce HIT
```

**Serious illness:**
- Medical clearance required
- Follow physician guidance
- Very gradual return over 4-8 weeks

### Return Protocol After Injury

**General guidelines:**
1. Get clearance from healthcare provider
2. Start with pain-free movement
3. Progress load gradually
4. Listen to body
5. Don't rush back

**Typical progression:**
```
Week 1-2: Pain-free movement, very easy
Week 3-4: Building volume, easy intensity
Week 5-6: Introducing moderate intensity
Week 7+: Gradual return to normal training
```

### Monitoring During Return

**Watch for:**
- Pain (stop if present)
- Excessive fatigue
- Poor sleep
- Mood changes
- HR elevation for given power

**Adjust if needed:**
- Take extra rest days
- Reduce intensity
- Extend timeline
- Consult healthcare provider

### Mental Aspect

- Accept temporary fitness loss
- Focus on long-term health
- Don't compare to pre-injury
- Celebrate small progress
- Be patient with timeline
