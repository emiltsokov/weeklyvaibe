## Race Types Overview

| Race Type | Key Demands | Primary Tactic |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Time Trial | Sustained power, pacing | Even power distribution |
| Criterium | Repeated surges, cornering | Position, sprint timing |
| Road Race | Endurance, tactical | Energy conservation, timing |
| Hill Climb | W/kg, pacing | Even effort, not even power |
| Gran Fondo | Endurance | Pacing, nutrition |

## Pacing Strategies

### Time Trial Pacing

**Even Power vs Even Speed:**
- Flat TT: Even power = optimal
- Hilly TT: Variable power (harder uphill)
- Wind: Harder into headwind, easier with tailwind

**Power Distribution:**
```
Flat TT:
- Start: 100-102% target (settle in)
- Middle: 100% target (steady)
- Final 20%: 100-105% (push if feeling good)

Hilly TT:
- Uphill: 105-110% FTP
- Downhill: 85-95% FTP (maintain momentum)
- Flat: 100% FTP
```

### Road Race Pacing

**Energy Conservation:**
- Draft as much as possible
- Avoid unnecessary surges
- Save matches for key moments
- Know your limiters

**When to Spend Energy:**
- Critical selection points
- Final kilometers
- Key climbs
- Breakaway attempts (calculated)

## Drafting and Positioning

### Drafting Mechanics

**Power Savings by Position:**

| Position | Power Saving | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Solo (front) | 0% | Full wind resistance |
| 2nd wheel | 25-35% | Optimal draft |
| 3rd wheel | 30-40% | Still significant |
| Mid-pack | 35-45% | Maximum savings |
| Back of pack | 20-30% | Yo-yo effect costs energy |

**Optimal Draft Distance:** 0.5-1.5 wheel lengths

### Peloton Positioning

**Front 1/3 Advantages:**
- See attacks developing
- Avoid crashes (pile-ups start at back)
- Better cornering lines
- First to key selections

**When to Move Up:**
- Before climbs
- Before technical sections
- Before crosswinds
- 3-5 km before key points

**Energy Cost of Position:**
- Moving from back to front: 20-50W extra for several minutes
- Staying at front vs mid: 10-20W extra sustained
- Worth it for safety and positioning

## Tactical Scenarios

### Crosswind Echelons

**Formation:**
```
Wind direction: →
       1  2  3
    4  5  6
 7  8  9
```

**Tactics:**
- Move to front before crosswind section
- Rotate smoothly in echelon
- If split happens, commit fully to front group
- Don't chase half-heartedly (wastes energy)

### Climbing Tactics

**On Long Climbs:**
- Start conservatively
- Find sustainable rhythm
- Attack only if planned
- Use grade changes strategically

**Attack Points:**
- Steeper gradients (gaps form faster)
- After false flat (others recovering)
- Counter-attack (others tired from chasing)

### Breakaway Tactics

**When to Attack:**
- After hard efforts (others recovering)
- On climbs or technical sections
- When team dynamics favor escape
- Early enough to build gap

**Breakaway Composition:**
- Ideally 3-6 riders
- Mix of abilities helps
- Need rotation commitment
- Avoid too many from same team

**Success Factors:**
- Gap at base of final climb: 2+ min for 10km climb
- Flat finish: Need 30+ sec with 5km to go
- Sprint finish: Unlikely to stay away

## Time Trial Execution

### Pre-Race

**Warm-up Protocol:**
```
-45 min: Start warm-up
-40 to -25 min: Progressive Z2
-25 to -20 min: 2x2 min @ threshold
-20 to -15 min: Easy spinning
-15 to -10 min: 2x30 sec @ VO2max
-10 to -5 min: Easy spinning
-5 min: Final prep, move to start
```

### Race Execution

**Start:**
- Controlled, not explosive
- Build to target power over 30-60 sec
- Settle into rhythm

**Middle:**
- Check power every 30 sec
- Stay in aero position
- Relax upper body
- Focus on smooth pedaling

**Finish:**
- Increase effort final 20%
- Don't leave anything in tank
- Maintain form to line

### Mental Focus

**Focus Points:**
- Breathing rhythm
- Pedal stroke
- Power number
- Course markers
- NOT the pain

## Criterium Racing

### Course Assessment

**Pre-race:**
- Walk the course
- Note corner speeds
- Identify danger zones
- Plan positioning points

### Positioning

**Corner Entry:**
- Front 10-15 at corner entry = exit in front
- Back at corner = accordion effect (constant surging)
- Inside line: Shorter but tighter
- Outside line: Longer but more speed

### Tactics

**Prime Sprints:**
- Useful for practice
- Can soften field
- Don't go all-out unless needed

**Final Laps:**
- Move up with 5 laps to go
- Stay top 15 with 3 laps to go
- Lead-out position with 1 lap to go

**Sprint Timing:**
```
- Start sprint: 200-250m out
- Jump timing: Follow wheels until final 150m
- Or: Long sprint if strong (400m out)
```

## Road Race Tactics

### Energy Budget

**Match Burning:**
- You have limited hard efforts
- Each attack/chase = 1 match
- Save matches for critical moments
- Know how many you have (training tells you)

### Key Moments

**When Selection Happens:**
1. Major climbs
2. Crosswind sections
3. Technical descents
4. Final kilometers
5. After long sustained efforts

### Team Tactics

**If Racing with Team:**
- Protect leader until key point
- Cover attacks strategically
- Block if breakaway is unfavorable
- Set tempo if advantageous

**If Racing Solo:**
- Follow moves with teammates of leaders
- Avoid doing work for rivals
- Save energy for your moment
- Find alliance of convenience
