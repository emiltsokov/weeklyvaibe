## Periodization Models

### Traditional (Linear) Periodization

**Structure:** Gradual progression from high volume/low intensity to low volume/high intensity.

**Phases:**
1. **General Preparatory (Base)** - 8-12 weeks
   - High volume, low intensity
   - Focus: Aerobic development
   - TSS: Building toward peak

2. **Specific Preparatory (Build)** - 6-8 weeks
   - Moderate volume, increasing intensity
   - Focus: Race-specific fitness
   - TSS: Peak levels

3. **Competition (Race)** - Variable
   - Reduced volume, high intensity
   - Focus: Racing, maintaining fitness

4. **Transition (Off-season)** - 2-4 weeks
   - Very low volume
   - Active recovery, cross-training

**Best for:**
- Beginners (need aerobic base)
- Long competitive seasons
- Year-round racing
- Single major peak

**Research basis:** Matveyev classical model, adapted for endurance sports.

---

### Block Periodization

**Structure:** Concentrated loading of specific stimuli in sequential blocks.

**Block Types:**
1. **Accumulation Block** (2-4 weeks)
   - High volume, moderate intensity
   - Focus: Aerobic base, work capacity
   - TSS: High (building)

2. **Transmutation Block** (2-3 weeks)
   - Moderate volume, high intensity
   - Focus: Convert base to race-specific
   - TSS: Moderate-high

3. **Realization Block** (1-2 weeks)
   - Low volume, race-specific intensity
   - Focus: Taper, peak performance
   - TSS: Reduced

**Research Evidence (Rønnestad et al. 2014, PMID: 22646668):**
- Block periodization: +8.1% power at 4mmol/L lactate
- Traditional: +3.2% power at 4mmol/L lactate
- Greater improvements in VO2max (+4.6% vs +1.2%)

**Best for:**
- Experienced cyclists (3+ years)
- Limited training time
- 1-3 targeted peak events
- Time-crunched athletes

**Sample Block Sequence:**
```
Accumulation (3 weeks):
- Week 1: 700 TSS, focus Z2 + tempo
- Week 2: 800 TSS, add sweet spot
- Week 3: 850 TSS, maintain

Recovery (1 week):
- Week 4: 400 TSS, easy riding

Transmutation (2 weeks):
- Week 5: 650 TSS, VO2max + threshold
- Week 6: 700 TSS, race-specific

Realization (1 week):
- Week 7: 350 TSS, taper
- Week 8: Race
```

---

### Reverse Periodization

**Structure:** Start with high intensity, progressively add volume.

**Phases:**
1. **High Intensity Foundation** (4-6 weeks)
   - Low volume, high intensity
   - Focus: VO2max, threshold
   - 6-8 hours/week

2. **Volume Integration** (4-6 weeks)
   - Increasing volume, moderate intensity
   - Focus: Building endurance while maintaining intensity

3. **Endurance Emphasis** (4-6 weeks)
   - High volume, race-specific
   - Focus: Fatigue resistance

**Best for:**
- Masters athletes (40+) - tolerate intensity early, volume later
- Indoor training season - intensity more engaging
- Late-season peak events
- Returning from time off

**Sample Progression:**
```
Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4):
- 6-8 hours/week
- 3x VO2max sessions
- Minimal endurance

Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8):
- 10-12 hours/week
- 2x VO2max, 1x threshold
- Adding endurance rides

Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12):
- 14-16 hours/week
- 1x VO2max maintenance
- Long endurance emphasis
```

### Polarized Periodization

**Structure:** Emphasize extremes - easy and hard - minimize middle.

**Training Distribution:**
- 75-80% below LT1 (easy)
- <5% between LT1-LT2 (grey zone)
- 15-20% above LT2 (hard)

**Research Evidence (Seiler 2010, PMID: 20861519; Stöggl & Sperlich 2014, PMID: 24550842):**
- Superior VO2max improvements vs threshold training
- Better performance gains in trained athletes
- Lower injury/overtraining risk

**Weekly Structure Example:**
```
Monday: Rest
Tuesday: VO2max intervals (hard)
Wednesday: Z2 endurance (easy)
Thursday: Z2 endurance (easy)
Friday: Rest or easy spin
Saturday: Threshold/race-pace (hard)
Sunday: Long Z2 ride (easy)
```

### Deload Frequency Guidelines

| Athlete Type | Frequency |
|--------------|-----------|
| Beginner | Every 6-8 weeks |
| Intermediate | Every 4-5 weeks |
| Advanced | Every 3-4 weeks |
| Elite/Masters | Every 2-3 weeks |

### Signs You Need Unplanned Deload

- Resting HR elevated >5 bpm for 3+ days
- HRV consistently decreasing
- Performance declining despite adequate training
- Sleep quality deteriorating
- Mood disturbances
- Elevated perceived effort for normal workouts
- Increased illness susceptibility

## Training Load Progression

### CTL Building Guidelines

| Phase | Weekly CTL Increase |
|-------|---------------------|
| Conservative | 3-5 points |
| Moderate | 5-7 points |
| Aggressive | 7-10 points |

**Ramp Rate Calculation:**
```
Ramp Rate = (Target CTL - Current CTL) / Weeks Available
```

### ACWR Management

Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio = ATL / CTL

| ACWR | Risk Level | Action |
|------|------------|--------|
| <0.8 | Detraining risk | Increase load |
| 0.8-1.0 | Low risk | Optimal training |
| 1.0-1.3 | Moderate risk | Monitor closely |
| 1.3-1.5 | High risk | Reduce load |
| >1.5 | Very high risk | Significant reduction |

### TSB Target Zones

| Situation | Target TSB |
|-----------|------------|
| Hard training | -20 to -40 |
| Maintenance | -10 to +10 |
| Pre-race taper | +5 to +25 |
| Race day | +10 to +20 |
| Post-race recovery | +20 to +30 |
