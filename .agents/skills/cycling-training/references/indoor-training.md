## Indoor vs Outdoor Differences

### Physiological Differences

**Key research findings:**

| Study | Power Difference | Notes |
|-------|------------------|-------|
| Mieras 2014 (PMID: 24476776) | 208W outdoor vs 163W indoor | 27% at same RPE |
| Lipski 2022 (PMID: 35361736) | 4.2-8.8% lower indoor | 1-14 min tests |
| Bertucci 2012 | 20-50W lower indoor | With adequate fans |

**Detailed comparison:**

| Factor | Indoor | Outdoor | Research Source |
|--------|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Power output | Lower | Higher | -5 to -27% (depends on cooling) |
| Heart rate | 143 bpm | 152 bpm | Mieras 2014 (PMID: 24476776) (same RPE) |
| Skin temp | 33.0°C | 31.4°C | Mieras 2014 (PMID: 24476776) |
| Cadence | +5-6 RPM | Baseline | Lipski 2022 (PMID: 35361736) |
| Critical Power | 330W | 348W | Lipski 2022 (PMID: 35361736) (18W/5.5% diff) |

### Why Indoor Feels Harder

1. **No airflow** - Reduced evaporative cooling
2. **Constant load** - No coasting, continuous pedaling
3. **Static position** - Less movement variety
4. **Mental monotony** - Reduced stimulation
5. **Heat accumulation** - Body temperature rises faster

### Adjusting Indoor FTP

**Options:**
1. Use 95% of outdoor FTP for indoor workouts
2. Perform indoor-specific FTP test
3. Use AI FTP detection (TrainerRoad)

**Recommendation:** Test indoors if >50% of training is indoors.

## Setup Optimization

### Cooling (Critical)

**Fernandez et al. 2023 findings (fan at ~4 m/s; PMID: 35025720):**
- Mean workload was ~15% higher with fan cooling (at the same HRR target)
- 9% higher oxygen consumption
- 14% greater energy expenditure (344 vs 302 kcals)
- Lower thermal sensation, same RPE
- Reduced body mass loss (0.4 vs 0.6 kg)

**Minimum requirements:**
- 1 powerful fan (40cm+) aimed at torso/face
- Airflow: minimum 3-4 m/s
- Room temperature <20°C (ideally 15-18°C)

**Optimal setup:**
- 2-3 fans: Front (face), side (torso), rear
- Air conditioning if available
- Open windows for fresh air exchange

### Trainer Types & Accuracy Hierarchy

**Accuracy ranking (Rodríguez-Rielves 2022):**

| Tier | Device | Accuracy |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Lab ergometers (Lode, SRM) | ~0.5% |
| 2 | SRM cranks | ~1% |
| 3 | High-end direct-drive (KICKR, Neo) | ±1-2% |
| 4 | Dual-sided pedals (Assioma, Rally) | ±1-2% |
| 5 | Single-sided (Stages, 4iiii) | ~2% |
| 6 | Mid-range direct-drive | ±2-3% |
| 7 | Wheel-on smart trainers | ±3-5% |

**Direct Drive (Smart Trainers):**
- Wahoo KICKR V6: ±1% accuracy, auto-calibration
- Tacx Neo 2T: ±1% accuracy
- Elite Direto, Saris H3: ±2-2.5%
- Best for: Structured training, ERG mode

**Wheel-on Trainers:**
- Wahoo KICKR Snap, Tacx Flow
- Accuracy: ±3-5% (affected by tire pressure, temp, contact)
- Requires: Proper tire pressure, calibration
- Power match: Recommended if using power meter

**Rollers:**
- Elite, Tacx, Kreitler
- Better for: Pedaling technique, warm-up
- Less suitable for: Hard structured intervals

### Calibration Protocol

**Before every session:**
1. Warm up trainer for 10 minutes
2. Perform spindown calibration
3. Check tire pressure (wheel-on)
4. Verify power readings against power meter (if available)

**Weekly:**
- Full spindown calibration
- Check for firmware updates

### Bike Setup

- **Handlebars:** Can be slightly higher than road setup
- **Position:** Identical to outdoor for specificity
- **Towel:** Protect frame from sweat
- **Mat:** Under trainer for sweat/noise

## Training Modes

### ERG Mode

**How it works:** Power = Torque × Cadence. Trainer adjusts resistance multiple times per second to maintain target power.

**Advantages:**
- Perfect power execution for structured workouts
- Higher "quality time" at target intensity
- Removes technical barriers for beginners
- Enforces training plan adherence
- Builds mental toughness
- Produces cleaner training data

**Limitations:**
- "Spiral of death" if cadence drops too low
- Not suitable for short efforts (<30 sec)
- Reduced neuromuscular variability
- May not develop pacing skills

**When to use:**
- Endurance and tempo workouts
- Sweet spot and threshold intervals (>1 min)
- When distracted by entertainment

**When NOT to use:**
- Sprint intervals (<30 sec)
- Neuromuscular power development
- Race simulation

**Gear selection in ERG:**
- Big gear (53×11): More inertia, mimics flat/fast riding
- Small gear (39×28): Less inertia, mimics climbing, faster response

**"ERG Spiral" Prevention:**
Maintain cadence >70 RPM; shift to easier gear proactively if fatiguing.
- Solution: Shift to easier gear
- Solution: Pedal faster momentarily
- Some trainers have "ERG smoothing"

### Slope/Level Mode (Simulation)

**How it works:** Trainer simulates gradient; you control power through gears and cadence.

**Best for:**
- Race simulation
- VO2max intervals (need power surges)
- Zwift racing
- Practicing pacing
- Variable power workouts

**Tips:**
- Use gears like outdoors
- Practice accelerations
- Better for sprint work

### Standard Mode (Resistance)

**How it works:** Fixed resistance curve based on speed.

**Best for:**
- Endurance rides
- Free riding
- When ERG feels too constraining

## Heat Management

### Indoor Heat Adaptation

Indoor training can be used intentionally for heat acclimation.

**Heat Acclimation Protocol:**
1. Train without fan / minimal cooling
2. Room temp: 28-32°C
3. Duration: 60-90 min Z2
4. Frequency: 5-7 consecutive days
5. Monitor core temp if possible

**Expected adaptations (after 5-10 days):**
- Earlier sweating onset
- Increased sweat rate
- Lower exercising HR
- Lower core temperature
- Improved heat tolerance

**See:** [environmental.md](environmental.md) for detailed protocols

### Hydration for Indoor Training

**Pre-session:**
- 500-750 mL 2-4 hours before
- Additional 250-500 mL 30 min before

**During:**
- 500-1000 mL per hour (individual)
- Electrolyte drink for sessions >60 min
- Sodium: 500-1000 mg/hour if heavy sweater

**Post:**
- Replace 150% of fluid lost
- Include sodium
- Weigh before/after to track loss

### Sweat Management

- Use towel on handlebars
- Sweat guard/frame protector
- Mat under trainer
- Ventilation for moisture removal
- Change kit between sessions if double day

## Mental Strategies

### Combating Indoor Monotony

1. **Entertainment:**
   - Movies/TV shows for endurance
   - Music playlists for intervals
   - Podcasts for easy rides
   - Zwift/video games for engagement

2. **Chunking:**
   - Break long sessions into mental segments
   - "Just 10 more minutes"
   - Focus interval by interval

3. **Goal Setting:**
   - Weekly TSS targets
   - Power PBs to chase
   - Zwift achievements/badges

4. **Variety:**
   - Alternate platforms
   - Mix workout types
   - Group rides/races
   - Different "routes" even in ERG

### Focus Strategies for Hard Intervals

1. **Process focus:** Cadence, breathing, form
2. **Countdown:** Seconds remaining
3. **Mantras:** "Smooth is fast", "Relax"
4. **Music timing:** Build to crescendo
5. **Competition:** Race virtual opponents

### Motivation Maintenance

- Schedule sessions like appointments
- Train with others virtually
- Track progress visibly
- Reward completion
- Remember outdoor season goals
- Mix hard/easy appropriately

## Indoor-Specific Considerations

### When to Train Indoor vs Outdoor

**Indoor preferred:**
- Poor weather
- Darkness
- Structured intervals requiring precision
- Heat acclimation
- Recovery rides (shorter, controlled)

**Outdoor preferred:**
- Long endurance rides (>2.5 hr)
- Race simulation/skills
- Mental freshness
- Group rides
- When weather permits

### Trainer Tire vs Regular Tire

**Trainer-specific tires:**
- More durable
- Quieter
- Designed for heat
- Recommended for wheel-on trainers

**Quick-release wheels:**
- Dedicated trainer wheel with trainer tire
- Swap easily between indoor/outdoor
