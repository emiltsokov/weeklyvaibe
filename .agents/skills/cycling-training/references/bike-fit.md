## Saddle Position

### Saddle Height

**Measurement Methods:**

| Method | Formula/Approach | Accuracy |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| Inseam × 0.883 | Hamley formula | Good starting point |
| Heel method | Heel on pedal, leg straight | Quick approximation |
| Knee angle | 25-35° at 6 o'clock | Most accurate |
| Holmes method | 25-30° flexion at BDC | Research-validated |

**Optimal Knee Angle:**
- At bottom dead center (BDC): 25-35° flexion
- Too low (<25°): Hip rocking, power loss, hamstring strain
- Too high (>40°): Knee pain, quad overload, saddle sores

**Research (Bini et al. 2011, PMID: 21615186):**
- 5mm saddle height change = measurable power/efficiency difference
- Individual variation requires testing, not just formulas

### Saddle Fore-Aft (Setback)

**KOPS Method (Knee Over Pedal Spindle):**
- Plumb line from knee cap at 3 o'clock position
- Line should fall through pedal spindle ±1cm
- Starting point only - adjust based on feel

**Considerations:**
- Forward = more quad dominant
- Rearward = more glute/hamstring
- Affects reach to handlebars

### Saddle Tilt

**Guideline:** Level or 1-2° nose down

**Issues from incorrect tilt:**
- Nose up: Perineal pressure, numbness
- Nose too far down: Sliding forward, arm/hand pressure

---

## Handlebar Setup

### Reach

**Definition:** Horizontal distance from saddle to handlebars

**Optimal range:**
- Arms slightly bent (10-15°) when on hoods
- Shoulders relaxed, not hunched
- No excessive weight on hands

**Adjustment:**
- Stem length: 80-130mm range typical
- Stem angle: Positive/negative rise
- Spacers under stem: Height adjustment

### Drop

**Definition:** Vertical difference between saddle and handlebars

**Guidelines by riding style:**

| Style | Drop (cm) | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Recreational | 0-2 | Upright, comfortable |
| Endurance | 2-5 | Balanced |
| Racing | 5-10 | Aggressive, aero |
| TT/Triathlon | 8-15+ | Maximum aero |

### Handlebar Width

**Guideline:** Match shoulder width (measured at AC joint)

**Effects:**
- Too narrow: Breathing restriction, instability
- Too wide: Aero penalty, shoulder strain

---

## Cleat Position

### Fore-Aft Position

**Optimal:** Ball of foot over pedal spindle (±5mm)

**Adjustment effects:**
- Forward: More calf engagement, ankle mobility needed
- Rearward: More stable, less calf strain

### Rotational Alignment (Float)

**Research (Ruby & Hull 1993, PMID: 8240820):**
- Neutral rotation minimizes knee stress
- Most riders need 4-6° float
- Fixed cleats increase injury risk

**Setting float:**
- Start with neutral position
- Allow natural rotation
- Adjust if discomfort persists

### Cleat Tilt (Varus/Valgus)

**Signs of need:**
- Knee tracking issues
- Hot spots on foot
- Arch pain

**Solutions:**
- Cleat wedges (1-3° typical)
- Custom insoles
- Specialized cleats

---

## Indoor-Specific Considerations

### Trainer Position Differences

**Research findings:**
- Fixed position = no bike movement
- May need different setup than outdoor
- Hip angle changes without bike lean

**Common adjustments for indoor:**

| Parameter | Adjustment | Reason |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| Saddle height | Same or -2mm | Less bike movement |
| Saddle tilt | May need slight nose down | Different hip position |
| Handlebar height | Consider +5-10mm | Comfort for long sessions |
| Rocker plate | Recommended | Mimics outdoor movement |

### Rocker Plates

**Benefits:**
- Allows natural bike movement
- Reduces static position stress
- More realistic feel
- May reduce saddle discomfort

**Research:** Limited but growing evidence of comfort improvement

### Fan Position Impact

**Consideration:** Wind resistance affects position
- Outdoors: Head up into wind
- Indoors: May allow more aggressive position

## Common Fit Issues

### Knee Pain

| Location | Likely Cause | Solution |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| Anterior (front) | Saddle too low/forward | Raise saddle, move back |
| Posterior (back) | Saddle too high | Lower saddle |
| Lateral (outside) | Cleat rotation, Q-factor | Adjust cleat, check stance width |
| Medial (inside) | Cleat rotation, valgus | Adjust cleat, consider wedges |

### Numbness

| Area | Likely Cause | Solution |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Hands | Too much weight forward | Raise bars, shorter stem |
| Feet | Tight shoes, cleat position | Loosen straps, adjust cleats |
| Perineum | Saddle position/shape | Adjust tilt, try different saddle |

### Lower Back Pain

**Common causes:**
- Too much reach
- Too aggressive position
- Poor core strength
- Saddle too high

**Solutions:**
- Shorten reach (shorter stem)
- Raise handlebars
- Core strengthening
- Proper bike fit assessment

### Hot Spots / Pressure Points

**Saddle issues:**
- Width mismatch (sit bone measurement needed)
- Shape incompatibility
- Incorrect tilt

**Foot issues:**
- Cleat position
- Shoe fit
- Arch support

## Self-Fit Protocol

### Basic Self-Assessment (30 min)

**Equipment needed:**
- Plumb line (string + weight)
- Tape measure
- Phone for video
- Trainer/stationary setup

**Step 1: Current position baseline**
```
Record current measurements:
- Saddle height (center of BB to top of saddle)
- Saddle setback (horizontal from BB center)
- Saddle to handlebar drop
- Reach (saddle tip to handlebar center)
```

**Step 2: Saddle height check**
```
1. Sit on bike, clip in
2. Place heel on pedal at 6 o'clock
3. Leg should be straight (no reaching)
4. Adjust if needed, retest
```

**Step 3: KOPS check**
```
1. Pedal to 3 o'clock position
2. Drop plumb line from front of knee cap
3. Should fall through/near pedal spindle
4. Adjust fore-aft if needed
```

**Step 4: Reach/drop assessment**
```
1. Ride for 15+ min at moderate effort
2. Note: Hand numbness? Neck pain? Lower back?
3. Arms should be slightly bent on hoods
4. Shoulders relaxed
```

**Step 5: Video analysis**
```
1. Record from side during ride
2. Check knee angle at BDC (25-35°)
3. Check hip angle (45-55° with torso)
4. Note any rocking or reaching
```

### When to Seek Professional Fit

- Persistent pain despite adjustments
- Significant flexibility limitations
- Previous injuries affecting position
- Performance plateau despite training
- New bike purchase
