## Common Scenarios

| Question | Quick Answer | Details |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| 6 hours/week structure? | 2x intervals + 1x long ride + recovery | [special-populations.md](special-populations.md) |
| Indoor training tips? | Fan first, 45-75 min optimal | [indoor-training.md](indoor-training.md) |
| FTP duration pacing? | 20min=100%, 60min=90-95% | [zones-and-testing.md](zones-and-testing.md) |
| When retest FTP? | Every 4-6 weeks in build | [zones-and-testing.md](zones-and-testing.md) |
| How to taper? | Week-2: 60-70%, Week-1: 40-50% TSS | [periodization.md](periodization.md) |
| Sweet spot duration? | 2×20min or 3×15min @ 88-94% | [workouts.md](workouts.md) |
| VO2max interval length? | Optimal 140s work, 165s recovery | [workouts.md](workouts.md) |
| Masters recovery? | 48-72h between hard sessions | [special-populations.md](special-populations.md) |
| Indoor FTP adjustment? | Use 95% of outdoor or test indoors | [indoor-training.md](indoor-training.md) |
| Deload frequency? | Every 3-4 weeks (2-3 for masters) | [periodization.md](periodization.md) |

## Metrics Quick Reference

```
TSS = (Duration_sec × NP × IF) / (FTP × 3600) × 100
IF = NP / FTP
VI = NP / AP
CTL = 42-day exponentially weighted average of TSS
ATL = 7-day exponentially weighted average of TSS
TSB = CTL - ATL
ACWR = ATL / CTL (sweet spot: 0.8-1.3)
```

## Race Day TSB Targets

| Event Type | Optimal TSB |
|------------|-------------|
| Training race | -10 to +5 |
| B race | +5 to +15 |
| A race | +15 to +25 |
| Grand Tour stage | +5 to +15 |
