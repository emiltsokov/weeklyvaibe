## Outdoor vs Indoor Differences

### Power Output

| Factor | Indoor | Outdoor |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Sustained power | Lower (-5-10%) | Higher (baseline) |
| RPE at same wattage | Higher | Lower |
| Cooling | Limited | Natural airflow |
| Power variability | Low (ERG) | High (terrain/traffic) |
| Neuromuscular demand | Lower | Higher (balance, handling) |

### When to Train Outdoor vs Indoor

**Outdoor preferred:**
- Long endurance rides (>2.5 hr)
- Race simulation and group rides
- Skill development (descending, cornering)
- Mental freshness after indoor blocks
- Variable power/terrain workouts

**Indoor preferred:**
- Precise interval execution
- Time-limited sessions
- Poor weather/darkness
- Recovery rides (controlled)
- Heat acclimation protocols

---

## Workout Execution Outdoors

### Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Traffic interruptions | Scout routes, use power targets not time |
| Variable terrain | Adjust targets to gradient |
| Wind | Use RPE alongside power |
| Temperature changes | Adjust expectations |
| Safety at high intensity | Choose low-traffic routes/times |

### Interval Execution Guidelines

**Sweet Spot / Threshold Intervals:**
```
Route selection:
- Long gradual climbs (3-6% gradient)
- Quiet roads with minimal stops
- Closed loops if possible

Execution:
- Start interval at bottom of climb
- Maintain power through gradient changes
- Accept ±5% power variability
- Use average power, not instant
```

**VO2max Intervals:**
```
Route requirements:
- 4-6 min uninterrupted sections
- Moderate gradient (4-8%)
- Safe turnaround or loop

Execution:
- Higher power on flats, lower on steep
- Target HR response, not just power
- Full recovery between intervals (descend easy)
```

**Sprint Work:**
```
Location: Flat, wide, low-traffic
Surface: Good tarmac, no gravel
Visibility: Clear sightlines
Wind: Ideally tailwind or calm
```

### Power Target Adjustments by Terrain

| Gradient | Power Adjustment | Cadence Target |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| -5% to -2% | +10-15% | 95-105 rpm |
| -2% to +2% | Baseline | 85-95 rpm |
| +2% to +5% | -5% | 75-85 rpm |
| +5% to +8% | -10% | 65-80 rpm |
| >+8% | -15-20% | 60-75 rpm |

## Terrain-Specific Training

### Climbing

**Hill Repeat Session:**
```
Find: 5-10 min climb at 5-8% gradient

Protocol:
- 4-6 repeats
- Effort: Threshold to VO2max
- Descent: Easy recovery
- Focus: Steady pacing, seated vs standing mix

Progression:
Week 1: 4×5 min @ 95% FTP
Week 2: 4×6 min @ 95% FTP
Week 3: 5×6 min @ 97% FTP
Week 4: 3×8 min @ 100% FTP
```

**Long Climb Training:**
```
Purpose: Sustained climbing for gran fondos/mountains

Find: 20-45 min continuous climb

Session types:
1. Tempo climb: Steady 80-85% FTP entire climb
2. Progressive: Start 75%, finish 95% FTP
3. Race simulation: Variable power with surges
```

**Seated vs Standing:**

| Technique | When to Use | Power Impact |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Seated | Sustained efforts, saving energy | Baseline |
| Standing | Accelerations, steep gradients, fatigue relief | +5-15% short-term |
| Mix | Long climbs (alternate every 1-2 min) | Optimal fatigue management |

### Descending

**Skills to develop:**
- Line choice through corners
- Braking zones and technique
- Body position (low, relaxed)
- Vision (look through corner)
- Confidence progression

**Practice protocol:**
```
1. Start with familiar descents
2. Gradually increase speed
3. Focus on smooth, not fast
4. Practice in dry conditions first
5. Learn to read road surface
```

### Windy Conditions

**Headwind:**
- Reduce power target 5-10%
- Lower body position
- Adjust expectations
- Group: Rotate more frequently

**Crosswind:**
- Stay alert for gusts
- Grip handlebars firmly
- Adjust body position
- Group: Echelon formation

**Tailwind:**
- Opportunity for speed work
- Increase power target 5-10%
- Practice high-speed pedaling
- Good for TT simulation

## Group Ride Dynamics

### Drafting Efficiency

| Speed | Power Savings | Position |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| 30 km/h | 15-20% | 2nd wheel |
| 40 km/h | 25-35% | 2nd wheel |
| 50 km/h | 35-45% | 2nd wheel |

**Optimal drafting distance:** 0.5-1.5m (closer = more savings, higher risk)

### Paceline Etiquette

**Single paceline:**
```
1. Pull at sustainable pace
2. Pull duration: 30 sec - 2 min
3. Signal before pulling off (elbow flick)
4. Pull off into wind
5. Soft-pedal while dropping back
6. Slot in smoothly at back
```

**Double paceline (rotating):**
```
1. Advancing line slightly faster
2. Short pulls (10-30 sec)
3. Continuous rotation
4. Communication essential
5. Match speed when moving over
```

### Group Ride Training Value

| Ride Type | Training Benefit | TSS/hr |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| Easy social | Recovery, base | 40-50 |
| Tempo group | Aerobic endurance | 60-70 |
| Fast chain gang | Threshold, tactics | 80-100 |
| Racing | VO2max, race-specific | 90-120+ |

### Safety in Groups

- **Communicate:** Holes, obstacles, slowing, stopping
- **Predictable:** No sudden movements
- **Overlap:** Never overlap wheels
- **Attention:** Watch 2-3 riders ahead
- **Braking:** Feather, don't grab

### Camp Structure

**7-Day Camp Example:**
```
Day 1: Travel + easy spin (60 min)
Day 2: Long endurance (4-5h, moderate terrain)
Day 3: Mountain day (3-4h, climbing focus)
Day 4: Recovery ride (2h easy) OR rest
Day 5: Intervals (2-3h with structured work)
Day 6: Big ride (5-6h, main objective)
Day 7: Easy spin + travel
```

**Load management:**
- Don't exceed 2× normal weekly TSS
- Include 1-2 easy/rest days
- Front-load volume if short camp
- Back off 2-3 days before key efforts

### Recovery During Camps

**Daily protocol:**

## Outdoor vs Indoor Integration

### Seasonal Approach

**Winter (Nov-Feb):**
```
Indoor: 70-80%
Outdoor: 20-30% (weather permitting)
Focus: Base building, structured intervals indoors
Outdoor for: Weekend long rides when dry
```

**Spring (Mar-May):**
```
Indoor: 30-40%
Outdoor: 60-70%
Focus: Transition, maintain indoor intensity sessions
Outdoor for: Endurance, group rides, skills
```

**Summer (Jun-Aug):**
```
Indoor: 10-20%
Outdoor: 80-90%
Focus: Racing, outdoor specificity
Indoor for: Recovery rides, poor weather backup
```

**Autumn (Sep-Oct):**
```
Indoor: 20-40%
Outdoor: 60-80%
Focus: Late season racing, transition back
Indoor for: Intensity maintenance as daylight drops
```

### Weekly Integration Example

**10-hour week (spring/summer):**
```
Mon: Rest
Tue: Indoor intervals (1h) - precision
Wed: Outdoor endurance (1.5h) - commute or evening
Thu: Indoor sweet spot (1h) - controlled
Fri: Rest or easy spin
Sat: Outdoor group ride (3h) - social, variable
Sun: Outdoor long ride (2.5h) - terrain, skills
```
