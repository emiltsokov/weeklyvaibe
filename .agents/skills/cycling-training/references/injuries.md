## Injury Prevention Principles

### Training Load Management

**ACWR (Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio):**
- Sweet spot: 0.8-1.3
- High risk: >1.5
- Spike in load = injury risk increase

**Progressive overload:**
- Volume increase: Max 10% per week
- CTL increase: 3-7 points per week
- Deload every 3-4 weeks

### Bike Fit

**Critical factors:**
- See [bike-fit.md](bike-fit.md) for detailed positioning
- Proper fit prevents 50%+ of overuse injuries
- Annual fit check recommended

### Strength Training

**Research (Sato & Mokha 2009, PMID: 19996779):**
- Core stability reduces low back pain
- Hip strength prevents IT band issues
- See [strength.md](strength.md) for protocols

### Flexibility

**Key areas for cyclists:**
- Hip flexors (shortened from cycling position)
- Hamstrings
- Thoracic spine
- Piriformis

---

## Knee Injuries

### Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS)

**Symptoms:**
- Anterior knee pain
- Pain worse with loading (climbing, high power)
- May have grinding sensation

**Common causes:**
- Saddle too low
- Saddle too far forward
- High cadence without adaptation
- Overtraining

**Treatment:**
1. Reduce training load 50%
2. Adjust bike fit (raise saddle, move back)
3. Strengthen VMO (vastus medialis)
4. Avoid high gear grinding

**Return to training:**
- Pain-free easy spinning first
- Gradual intensity increase over 2-4 weeks
- Address cause before resuming normal load

### IT Band Syndrome

**Symptoms:**
- Lateral knee pain
- Pain worse with repetitive motion
- May radiate up thigh

**Common causes:**
- Saddle too high
- Excessive cleat float
- Weak hip abductors
- Rapid volume increase

**Treatment:**
1. Rest from aggravating activity
2. Foam rolling (limited evidence but widely used)
3. Hip strengthening (clamshells, side planks)
4. Bike fit assessment

**Prevention protocol:**
```
Weekly routine:
- Hip strengthening 2x/week
- Foam rolling post-ride
- Gradual training increases
- Proper warm-up
```

### Patellar Tendinitis

**Symptoms:**
- Pain below kneecap
- Worse with high force (low cadence climbing)
- Morning stiffness

**Treatment:**
1. Load modification (avoid high force)
2. Eccentric strengthening
3. Ice after activity
4. Consider higher cadence temporarily

## Lower Back Issues

### Prevalence and Causes

**Research (Salai et al. 1999, PMID: 10386387):**
- 30-50% of cyclists experience
- Prolonged flexion main cause
- Position AND conditioning factors

### Prevention Strategies

**Bike fit:**
- Appropriate reach (not over-extended)
- Sufficient handlebar height
- Saddle tilt (not nose up)

**Conditioning:**
```
Core stability program (2-3x/week):
1. Plank: 3×30-60 sec
2. Dead bug: 3×10 each side
3. Bird dog: 3×10 each side
4. Glute bridge: 3×15
```

**On-bike strategies:**
- Position changes during long rides
- Standing periodically
- Proper endurance building

### Acute Low Back Pain Management

**Red flags (seek medical care):**
- Numbness in legs/groin
- Loss of bladder/bowel control
- Severe constant pain
- Weakness in legs

**Self-management:**
1. Reduce training (don't stop completely unless severe)
2. Shorter sessions, more upright position
3. Core activation exercises
4. Gentle stretching (cat-cow, knee-to-chest)

---

## Neck and Shoulder

### Neck Pain

**Causes:**
- Prolonged extension (looking up)
- Aggressive position (low bars)
- Poor upper body strength

**Solutions:**
- Raise handlebars
- Strengthen neck/upper back
- Regular position changes
- Shorter stem if needed

### Shoulder Pain

**Common issues:**
- Trapezius strain (holding position)
- AC joint stress (impacts/vibration)
- Rotator cuff (rare in cycling)

**Prevention:**
- Relaxed grip and shoulders
- Elbows slightly bent
- Upper body strength training
- Proper bar width

---

## Hand and Wrist

### Ulnar Neuropathy (Cyclist's Palsy)

**Symptoms:**
- Numbness in ring/pinky finger
- Weakness in hand
- Worse with prolonged riding

**Causes:**
- Pressure on ulnar nerve at wrist
- Excessive weight on hands
- Insufficient padding

**Solutions:**
1. Padded gloves
2. Gel bar tape
3. Change hand positions frequently
4. Reduce reach/raise bars
5. Core strength (less weight on hands)

### Carpal Tunnel Symptoms

**Symptoms:**
- Numbness in thumb, index, middle fingers
- Night pain/numbness
- Weakness in grip

**Management:**
- Similar to ulnar neuropathy
- Wrist positioning (neutral, not bent)
- Consider ergonomic bar extensions

---

## Saddle-Related Issues

### Perineal Numbness

**Research:** Common complaint, affects performance and health

**Causes:**
- Saddle pressure on pudendal nerve
- Incorrect saddle choice/position
- Prolonged sitting without movement

**Solutions:**
1. Saddle with cutout/relief channel
2. Adjust saddle tilt (slight nose down)
3. Stand periodically (every 10-15 min)
4. Proper sit bone width matching
5. Chamois cream

### Saddle Sores

**Prevention:**
- Quality chamois
- Chamois cream
- Proper hygiene (clean kit each ride)
- Gradual increase in saddle time
- Proper saddle fit

**Treatment:**
- Time off saddle if severe
- Keep area clean and dry
- Tea tree oil or similar antiseptic
- Medical attention if infected

## Overtraining Syndrome

### Diagnostic Criteria

**Early warning signs (Functional Overreaching):**
- Performance plateau/decline
- Elevated resting HR (+5 bpm)
- Decreased HRV trend
- Mood disturbances
- Sleep issues
- Increased illness frequency

**Overtraining syndrome (severe):**
- Persistent fatigue >2 weeks despite rest
- Performance decline despite recovery
- Hormonal disruption (cortisol, testosterone)
- Depression/anxiety
- Loss of motivation

### Diagnostic Protocol

```
Daily monitoring:
1. Morning resting HR (before getting up)
2. HRV measurement (consistent time/position)
3. Sleep quality (1-10 subjective)
4. Mood/motivation (1-10)
5. Muscle soreness (1-10)

Weekly assessment:
1. Performance vs prescribed (hitting targets?)
2. HR:power relationship (drift?)
3. Training load vs capacity (ACWR)
```

### Quantitative Markers

| Marker | Normal | Warning | Action Needed |
|--------|--------|---------|---------------|
| Resting HR change | ±3 bpm | +5-7 bpm | >7 bpm |
| HRV (RMSSD) change | ±10% | -15-20% | >20% decline |
| Sleep quality | 7-10 | 5-6 | <5 |
| Performance vs target | 95-105% | 90-95% | <90% |
| ACWR | 0.8-1.3 | 1.3-1.5 | >1.5 or <0.8 |

### Decision Matrix

```
Morning check reveals:
├── RHR +5 bpm AND HRV -15%
│   └── Reduce intensity, extend warm-up, monitor
├── RHR +7 bpm OR HRV -25%
│   └── Recovery day only, reassess tomorrow
├── 3+ consecutive days declining metrics
│   └── Deload week, address sleep/stress/nutrition
└── Performance <90% target for 2+ sessions
    └── Rest 2-3 days, then reassess
```

### Recovery Protocol

**Functional overreaching:**
- 3-7 days reduced training
- Maintain some activity (Z1-2 only)
- Address sleep, nutrition, stress

**Overtraining syndrome:**
- Complete rest 1-2 weeks
- Very gradual return (months)
- Medical evaluation
- Address underlying causes

## Return to Training Protocols

### After Acute Injury

```
Phase 1 (Week 1-2): Pain-free movement
- Very easy spinning only
- <55% FTP
- Short duration (20-30 min)
- Stop if pain returns

Phase 2 (Week 3-4): Build tolerance
- Easy to moderate (55-70% FTP)
- Progress duration before intensity
- Monitor symptoms daily

Phase 3 (Week 5-6): Return to intensity
- Introduce tempo/sweet spot
- 70-80% normal volume
- One intensity session per week initially

Phase 4 (Week 7+): Full return
- Normal training with caution
- Address cause of injury
- Preventive program maintenance
```

### After Illness

| Illness Severity | Rest Period | Return Protocol |
|------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Mild cold (above neck) | 1-2 days | Direct return when symptoms resolve |
| Flu (systemic) | Until symptom-free + 3 days | 50% volume week 1, 75% week 2 |
| COVID-19 | Per medical guidance | Gradual return over 2-4 weeks |
| Severe illness | Medical clearance | Very gradual, individualized |

## Cardiovascular Risks of Endurance Training

> **Medical disclaimer:** Educational content only. This is not medical advice. If you have symptoms (palpitations, syncope, chest pain, unusual dyspnea) or risk factors, consult a clinician and follow local guidelines.

### Key Research

| Finding | Threshold/Value | Source |
|---------|-----------------|--------|
| Atrial fibrillation in men - increased risk | >7 hrs/week intense | Eur Heart J 2020 (PMID: 31951255) |
| Atrial fibrillation - optimal protection | 1.5–4 hrs/week | Multiple meta-analyses |
| AF risk in endurance athletes | 4× higher than non-athletes | BJSM 2021 (PMID: 34253538) |
| Acute troponin after races | Normalizes within 72h | Eur J Appl Physiol 2023 |
| Right ventricle - overload | Correlates with intensity (HR zone 4) | La Gerche et al. 2012 (PMID: 22160404) |

### Dose-Response Relationship (J-curve)

```
AF Risk
    |
    |      .---.
    |     /     \
    |    /       \
    |   /         \_________
    |  /
----+---------------------------------> Training Volume
    | Sedentary  WHO      Extreme
    |         Recommended  (>10x WHO)
```

**Interpretation:**
- Sedentary lifestyle: Increased risk
- WHO recommendations (150 min moderate/75 min intense): Lowest risk
- Extreme volumes (>7 hrs intense/week): Risk increases again (in men)

### Practical Heuristics (context-dependent)

| Intensity | Men | Women |
|-----------|-----|-------|
| Vigorous/intense (Z4+) | ≤6 hrs/week | No clear limit |
| Total mixed training | ≤10 hrs/week (conservative) | — |
| Optimal for protection | 1.5–4 hrs/week intense | Up to 6+ hrs/week safe |

**Note:** Women do not show increased AF risk even at high volumes (Eur Heart J 2020).

### Mechanisms of Damage

**Acute (after demanding race/training):**
- Troponin elevation (cTnI) - normalizes within 72h
- Transient right ventricular dysfunction
- Prolonged T1 relaxation time (possible myocardial edema)

**Chronic (years of intensive training):**
- Dilation of right atrium and ventricle
- Myocardial fibrosis (substrate for arrhythmias)
- Increased risk of atrial fibrillation

### Warning Signs

**Consult a doctor immediately:**
- Palpitations during or after training
- Unusual dyspnea not matching exertion level
- Syncope (fainting) during exercise
- Chest pain

**Monitor and evaluate:**
- Lower limb edema
- Disproportionate fatigue
- Performance decline without obvious cause
- Newly developed heat intolerance

### Screening Considerations (discuss with a clinician)

| Age/Profile | Recommendation |
|-------------|----------------|
| <35 years, recreational | ECG before starting intensive training |
| 35-40 years, >8 hrs/week | ECG + echo, consultation |
| >40 years, active | ECG + echo every 2-3 years |
| >40 years, >10 hrs/week intense | Annual cardiology check-up |
| Symptomatic (any age) | Immediate examination |

### Protective Factors

**Reduce risk:**
- Polarized training (80/20) - less time in "grey zone"
- Regular recovery and deload weeks
- Adequate sleep (7-9 hours)
- Hydration and electrolytes

### Practical Recommendations

**For recreational cyclists (5-10 hrs/week):**
1. Maintain polarized distribution (80% Z1-2, 20% Z4+)
2. Limit time in HR zone 4+ to <4-6 hrs/week
3. Include regular deload weeks (every 3-4 weeks)
4. Monitor HRV and resting HR for signs of overload

**For masters cyclists (>40 years):**
1. Cardiology screening before starting intensive training
2. ECG + echo every 2-3 years if >8 hrs/week
3. Extended recovery between intensive sessions (48-72h)
4. Stop training immediately and consult if new symptoms appear

**For high-volume racers (>15 hrs/week):**
1. Annual cardiology check-up
2. Monitor structural changes via echo
3. Consider cardiac MRI if fibrosis suspected
4. Balance between performance and long-term health
