## Carbohydrate Strategies

### Daily Carbohydrate Requirements

| Training Load | Carbs (g/kg/day) | Example (70kg) |
|---------------|------------------|----------------|
| Rest/Very light | 3-5 | 210-350g |
| Moderate (1 hr/day) | 5-7 | 350-490g |
| High (1-3 hr/day) | 6-10 | 420-700g |
| Very high (4-5+ hr/day) | 8-12 | 560-840g |

### Periodized Carbohydrate Intake

**Train Low (Glycogen Depleted) - Research-Based Protocol:**

*Based on Burke "Fuel for the Work Required" framework (Sports Medicine, 2018)*

Benefits:
- Enhanced mitochondrial adaptations
- Improved fat oxidation
- Increased metabolic flexibility

**Three Train-Low Strategies:**

1. **Twice-daily training**
   - Morning: High-intensity with full glycogen
   - Afternoon: Low-intensity with depleted glycogen
   - Benefit: Enhanced mitochondrial gene expression

2. **Sleep Low Protocol** (PLOS ONE 2021)
   - Evening: High-intensity training
   - Overnight: Withhold carbs (protein allowed)
   - Morning: Low-intensity fasted training
   - Result: Improved FTP in trained cyclists

3. **Fasted Training**
   - Morning Z2 sessions before breakfast
   - Duration: 60-90 minutes maximum
   - Not for high-intensity

**Caution:** Never train low for:
- High-intensity sessions
- Key workouts
- When fatigued
- Female athletes at risk for RED-S

**Compete High:**
- Full glycogen stores for races/hard sessions
- Carb load 24-48 hours before: 8-12 g/kg/day
- Supercompensation achieves ~600g total glycogen

### During Training Fueling

| Session Duration | Carb Intake |
|------------------|-------------|
| <60 min | Not necessary |
| 60-90 min | 30-60g/hr (optional) |
| 90-150 min | 60g/hr |
| >150 min | 60-90g/hr |
| Racing | 90-120g/hr (with training) |

**Carb Sources During Riding:**

| Source | Carbs | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Gel (typical) | 20-30g | Quick absorption |
| Energy bar | 30-50g | Slower, more filling |
| Banana | 25g | Natural option |
| Sports drink (500ml) | 30-40g | Plus hydration |
| Rice cake | 25-40g | DIY option |

**Multiple Transportable Carbohydrates (MTC):**
- Glucose:fructose ratio 2:1 or 1:0.8
- Allows absorption >60g/hr (up to 90-120g)
- Elite cyclists (Tour de France 2024): up to 130g/hour
- Must train gut to tolerate

**Gut Training Protocol (12-week progression):**

| Weeks | Target | Focus |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 1-4 | 30-60 g/hr | Familiar products, low intensity |
| 5-8 | 60-90 g/hr | Add variety, race-intensity practice |
| 9-12 | 90-120 g/hr | Simulate race conditions, find limit |

*Start fueling within first 20-30 minutes, small frequent doses every 15-20 min.*

### Pre-Training Nutrition

**2-4 hours before:**
- 1-4g carbs/kg
- Moderate protein
- Low fat, low fiber
- Examples: Oatmeal, toast + banana, rice + chicken

**30-60 min before:**
- Optional 20-50g easily digestible carbs
- Avoid if causes GI distress

### Post-Training Nutrition

**Glycogen Window (2-4 hours post):**
- 1-1.2g carbs/kg/hr for first 4 hours (if rapid recovery needed)
- Or: Normal meal within 2 hours (if >24hr to next session)

**Priority of rapid refueling:**
- Two sessions same day
- Heavy training day
- Stage racing
- Before next hard session <8 hours

## Protein Requirements

### Daily Protein Needs

| Goal | Protein (g/kg/day) |
|------|-------------------|
| Endurance maintenance | 1.2-1.4 |
| Building/maintaining muscle | 1.6-1.8 |
| Energy restriction (weight loss) | 1.8-2.2 |
| Recovery from injury | 2.0-2.5 |

### Protein Timing

**Research findings (2022-2025):**

1. **Per-meal dose:** 20-40g (0.25-0.4g/kg)
   - Leucine threshold: ~2.5-3g per meal

2. **Distribution:** Spread across 4-5 meals/snacks
   - Better than single large dose

3. **Post-workout:** Within 2 hours
   - 20-30g quality protein
   - Can combine with carbs

4. **Before sleep:** 30-40g casein or mixed protein
   - Supports overnight recovery
   - May enhance adaptation

### Protein Sources

| Source | Protein per serve | Leucine |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| Whey protein (25g scoop) | 20-25g | 2.5-3g |
| Casein (30g) | 24g | 2g |
| Chicken breast (100g) | 31g | 2.4g |
| Eggs (2 large) | 12g | 1g |
| Greek yogurt (200g) | 20g | 1.8g |
| Tofu (150g) | 15g | 1g |
| Lentils (200g cooked) | 18g | 1.3g |

### Protein for Adaptation

**Key principles:**
- Adequate protein supports training adaptations
- Insufficient protein impairs recovery
- Endurance athletes often under-consume
- Don't fear protein will cause bulk

## Hydration

### Daily Fluid Requirements

**Baseline:** 30-40 mL/kg body weight
- 70kg athlete: 2.1-2.8 liters/day (before exercise)

### During Exercise

**Sweat rates:** 0.5-2.5 L/hour (highly individual)

**Goal:** Replace 80% of sweat losses
- Weigh before/after to determine rate
- 1 kg lost = 1 L fluid deficit

**Drink recommendations:**
| Conditions | Fluid per hour |
|------------|----------------|
| Cool, easy ride | 400-600 mL |
| Moderate temp, moderate effort | 600-800 mL |
| Hot, hard effort | 800-1200 mL |

### Sodium Considerations

**Why sodium matters:**
- Maintains plasma volume
- Enhances fluid absorption
- Prevents hyponatremia
- Replaces sweat losses

**Sweat sodium concentration:** 200-2000+ mg/L (individual variation)

**Sodium recommendations:**
| Duration/Intensity | Sodium/hour |
|--------------------|-------------|
| <60 min | Usually not needed |
| 60-90 min moderate | 300-500 mg |
| >90 min or intense | 500-1000 mg |
| Heavy sweater/hot | 1000-1500 mg |

### Hydration Monitoring

**Urine color:** Light yellow = well hydrated

**Morning weight:** Consistent = good hydration

**Post-exercise rehydration:**
- Drink 150% of weight lost
- Include sodium (enhances retention)
- Complete within 4-6 hours

### Sodium Loading (Pre-Event)

**Protocol (research-backed):**
- 24-48 hours before: Increase salt intake
- Evening before: Salty meal + extra fluids
- Morning: 500-1000 mg sodium with fluids
- Effect: Expanded plasma volume

## Supplements

### Tier 1: Strong Evidence

**Caffeine** (Guest et al. 2018, PMID: 29509641)
- Dose: 3-6 mg/kg (200-400 mg for most)
- Timing: 60 min pre-exercise
- Benefits: +3-5% endurance performance

*CYP1A2 Genetic Response:*
| Genotype | Response |
|----------|----------|
| AA (fast metabolizer) | Both 2 and 4 mg/kg improve performance |
| AC | No significant effect |
| CC (slow metabolizer) | 4 mg/kg may impair performance |

*Practical tip:* If caffeine causes anxiety, sleep issues, or GI distress, consider lower doses.

## Sleep Optimization

### Sleep Requirements

**Research recommendations (Walsh et al. 2021, BJSM):**
- Minimum: 7 hours
- Optimal: 8-9 hours
- Elite athletes: 9-10 hours

| Metric | Minimum | Optimal | Elite |
|--------|---------|---------|-------|
| Duration | 7 hours | 8-9 hours | 9-10 hours |
| Sleep efficiency | >85% | >90% | Monitor |
| Deep sleep | 15-20% | 20-25% | Critical for recovery |
| REM sleep | 20-25% | 25% | Cognitive restoration |

**Effects of insufficient sleep (<7 hours):**
- Impaired recovery and adaptation
- Reduced performance (explosive power, speed)
- Increased injury risk
- Compromised immune function
- Poor decision making
- Elevated RPE at same power output

### Sleep Hygiene for Athletes

1. **Consistent schedule:** Same bed/wake times
2. **Cool room:** 16-19°C (60-67°F)
3. **Dark environment:** Blackout curtains
4. **Screen curfew:** No screens 1 hr before bed
5. **Caffeine cutoff:** None after 2 PM
6. **Evening routine:** Wind-down ritual

### Training and Sleep Timing

**Evening training:**
- High-intensity may delay sleep onset
- Finish 3+ hours before bed if possible
- Cool shower to lower body temp
- May need to adjust if regular evening trainer

**Morning training:**
- Early wake times need early bed times
- Maintain adequate sleep duration
- Naps can help if sleep restricted

### Napping

**Benefits:**
- Improved alertness
- Enhanced recovery
- Cognitive restoration

**Guidelines:**
- Duration: 20-30 min (or 90 min full cycle)
- Timing: Early afternoon (1-3 PM)
- Avoid late naps (disturb night sleep)

### Sleep Tracking

**Useful metrics:**
- Total sleep time
- Sleep efficiency
- Wake episodes
- RHR and HRV during sleep

**Platforms:** Whoop, Oura, Garmin, Apple Watch

### Red Flags (Sleep Problems)

- Difficulty falling asleep (>30 min regularly)
- Frequent waking
- Not feeling rested despite adequate hours
- Snoring/breathing issues
- Excessive daytime sleepiness

**Action:** Consider sleep study if persistent issues

## Weight Management

### Body Composition for Cyclists

**Power-to-weight:**
- Critical for climbing
- Less important for flat TT

**Sustainable approach:**
- Gradual loss: 0.5-1% body weight per week
- Off-season: Ideal time for weight loss
- Build phase: Maintain, don't cut

### Caloric Deficit Guidelines

**Moderate deficit:** 300-500 kcal/day
- Preserves training capacity
- Sustainable long-term

**Protein priority:** 1.8-2.2 g/kg during deficit
- Preserves muscle mass
- Maintains performance

**Never cut during:**
- Key training blocks
- Race preparation
- High-volume periods

### Practical Weight Management

1. Track intake periodically (awareness)
2. Prioritize protein at each meal
3. High-fiber, high-volume foods for satiety
4. Time carbs around training
5. Don't eliminate food groups
6. Avoid extreme restriction
